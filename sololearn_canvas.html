    <!-- The HTML canvas is used to draw graphics that include everything from simple lines to complex graphic objects. The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics (usually JavaScript).The <canvas> element must have an id attribute so it can be referred to by JavaScript. getContext() returns a drawing context on the canva Basic knowledge of JavaScript is required to understand and use the Canvas.-->
    <canvas id="canvas1" width="200" height="100">
    </canvas>
    <script>
        var can = document.getElementById("canvas1"); 
        var ctx = can.getContext("2d");
        ctx.fillRect(20,20,100,100);
        ctx.fillStyle="green";

     </script>
     <!-- The HTML canvas is a two-dimensional grid. -->


    <!-- Drawing Shapes


    The fillRect(x, y, w, h) method draws a "filled" rectangle, in which w indicates width and h indicates height. The default fill color is black.

    A black 100*100 pixel rectangle is drawn on the canvas at the position (20, 20)
The fillStyle property is used to set a color, gradient, or pattern to fill the drawing.
Using this property allows you to draw a green-filled rectangle. 


The canvas supports various other methods for drawing:

Draw a Line
moveTo(x,y): Defines the starting point of the line.
lineTo(x,y): Defines the ending point of the line.

Draw a Circle
beginPath(): Starts the drawing.
arc(x,y,r,start,stop): Sets the parameters of the circle.
stroke(): Ends the drawing.

Gradients
createLinearGradient(x,y,x1,y1): Creates a linear gradient.
createRadialGradient(x,y,r,x1,y1,r1): Creates a radial/circular gradient.

Drawing Text on the Canvas
Font: Defines the font properties for the text.
fillText(text,x,y): Draws "filled" text on the canvas.
strokeText(text,x,y): Draws text on the canvas (no fill).
There are many other methods aimed at helping to draw shapes and images on the canvas.-->
