Canvas vs. SVG


Canvas
- Elements are drawn programmatically
- Drawing is done with pixels
- Animations are not built in
- High performance for pixels-based drawing operations
- Resolution dependent
- No support for event handlers
- You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
- Well suited for graphic-intensive games

SVG
- Elements are part of the page's DOM (Document object model)
- Drawing is done with vectors
- Effects, such as animations are built in
- Based on standard XML syntax, which provides better accessibility
- Resolution independent
- Support for event handlers
- Not suited for game applications
- Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (for example, Google Maps)
You can actually use both SVG and canvas on the same page, if needed.
However, you cannot just draw SVG onto a canvas, or vice-versa. -->



<!-- Working with Canvas


The Canvas element can be transformed. As an example, a text is written on the canvas at the coordinates (10, 30). 


The translate(x,y) method is used to move the Canvas.
x indicates how far to move the grid horizontally, and y indicates how far to move the grid vertically.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.


The rotate() Method

The rotate() method is used to rotate the HTML5 Canvas. The value must be in radians, not degrees.

Here is an example that draws the same rectangle before and after rotation is set:

ctx.rotate( (Math.PI /180) * 25);  //rotate25



The scale() Method


The scale() method scales the current drawing. 
It takes two parameters:
- The number of times by which the image should be scaled in the X-direction.
- The number of times by which the image should be scaled in the Y-direction.

ctx.scale(1.5, 4);
